# EE160
Counter Assembly for PIC18F4550
This is an Assembly project for EE160

PIC18F4550 was used

Function of Code:
  - The number for the minute digit is incremented for every 'ADD'(HIGH) button is pressed. Pull-down resistor was used in the fabrication of the system
  
  - If the 'Start' Button is pressed, it starts the counter, displaying the remaning minutes and seconds.
  
  - Once the timer reaches the last 10 second of the timer, it would display the seconds and centiseconds.
